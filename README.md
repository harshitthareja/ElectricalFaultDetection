## Electrical Fault Detection using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- This project focuses on detecting electrical faults using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The model is trained to identify and classify faults in electrical systems, ensuring improved safety and reliability. The project is implemented in Python using Google Colab, and the .ipynb file is available in this repository.
